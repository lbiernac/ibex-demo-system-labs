# Lab 0: Installing Development Software 

In this lab, we will install prerequisites for setting up your development environment on Windows, including the following:
- Visual Studio Code
- Docker
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with Ubuntu 20.04

</br>

## Install Docker 

Install Docker Desktop on Windows by following this tutorial: [https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)

### 1. Configure System Settings

Open Window's _Task Manager_. Navigate to "Performance/CPU" and ensure that "Virtualization" is listed as enabled. If virtualization is disabled, you will need to enable it in your BIOS settings.

### 2. Install Docker Desktop

Download and run the installer `Docker Desktop Installer.exe` from [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).

During the installation, under "Configuration", ensure that the option "Install required Windows components for WSL 2" is selected. 

Complete the installation and open _Docker Desktop_. 

Select "Yes" to agree to the Subscription Service Agreement. Docker Desktop is free for small businesses (fewer than 250 employees AND less than $10 million in annual revenue), personal use, education, and non-commercial open-source projects.

## Configure Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to use Ubuntu 20.04 (Required for Ibex)
Next, we will configure WSL 2, which allows us to build and run Linux-based containers on our Windows machine. For reference, the official documentation for WSL is found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). 

### 1. Install Ubuntu 20.04 using WSL

From the start menu, open _Turn Windows features on or off_ and make sure the options "Windows Subsystem for Linux" and "Virtual Machine Platform" are enabled. Then select "OK".

Open _Windows PowerShell_ as an administrator and run the command `wsl -l -v` to see the existing versions of WSL that are running. You can also run `wsl -l -o` to see all the available Linux distributions. 

The Ibex docker container requires Ubuntu 20.04, which is an older version of Linux than the WSL default. The following instructions specify this exact version of Ubuntu during configuration. 

Run the following command to install Ubuntu version 20.04. 
```bash
wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04
```

Once the installation is complete, the _Ubuntu_ terminal window will pop up. Follow the prompts to enter a username and password. 

You have successfully configured an Ubuntu environment on top of your Windows machine. We will use this Ubuntu environment for the remainder of the labs. Make a new folder (called a _"directory"_) for these labs using the following command:
``` bash
mkdir ibex-labs
```

### 2. Integrate Docker and Ubuntu 20.04.

Open _Docker Desktop_. Under "Settings/Resources/WSL Integration" enable "Ubuntu-20.24" under the heading "Enable integration with additional distros". 

Return to the Ubuntu terminal and type the command `docker` to ensure that the integration is complete. This command will print all available docker commands.


### 3. Accessing your Linux File System in File Explorer:
You may want to navigate to your Linux files from File Explorer, rather than through the Ubuntu terminal. These files are not located in your Window's home directory (e.g., `C:\Users\USERNAME\ibex-labs`). Instead, they will be located at a path corresponding to the Linux environment's file system. This path will look something like: `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu-20.04\home\USERNAME\ibex-labs`.

Locate the folder `ibex-labs` within the Ubuntu terminal and the native file explorer. 


</br></br>
## Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
We will use Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, as an IDE for these labs. In future steps, we will configure VS Code to show both the Ubuntu terminal and docker container directly in the application window.  

### 1. Install VS Code
Download and run the VS Code installer: [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). 

Complete the installation and open _Visual Studio Code_. Navigate to the folder corresponding to your Ubuntu environment.

Alternatively, from the Ubuntu terminal, you can open the project directory in VS Code using the command: `code ibex-labs/`. This command will boot a new version of VS Code with the corresponding folder. 

### 2. Access the Ubuntu Terminal from VS Code
Open a terminal window inside of VS Code. The terminal may default to a "powershell" terminal, indicated by the text in the upper right-hand corner. Change the terminal to a Linux terminal by selecting the dropdown next to the +-sign and set the terminal to "Ubuntu-20.24 (WSL)". This gives you the same Ubuntu terminal you had previously.

This terminal is analogous to the separate Ubuntu terminal we were using earlierâ€”it is just now integrated into the VS Code IDE. 

Install the "Docker" extension for VS Code by navigating to _Extensions_ (Ctrl+Shift+X) and searching for the extension titled "Docker" and produced by Microsoft. After installing this extension, the Docker icon will appear as an option on the left-hand sidebar. We will use this extension later in the labs.

## Install Git 

We must also install Git on our new Linux environment in order to pull from the lowRISC Ibex repositories. If you are new to Git, the following resources may be helpful: 
- [https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture](https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture)
- [https://learngitbranching.js.org/](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
- [https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git/modules/learn-git-git-workflow-u/cheatsheet](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git/modules/learn-git-git-workflow-u/cheatsheet)

The final dependency for proceeding with the Ibex labs is to install git. From the Linux terminal, enter and run the following command: 

```bash 
sudo apt-get install git
```

You should also take a minute to generate and configure a new SSH key in WSL for your GitHub account. You can find information on how to do so [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).  

__Now we are ready to set up the Ibex environment and build the docker container!__
